    content: "We met through an arranged marriage setup. That day, we never thought we would make it this far. But someone has said it right - Marriages are made in heaven, and following God's principles will allow us to experience more of heaven on earth. We know that the love stories of arranged marriages are so underrated. But this moment started a budding love story between two INFJs."

    content: "Arranged marriage can be scary at times. So before things go ahead, we decided to meet outside informally. Mocha Sky Cafe - The place where we approved this unity of two unknown souls, written write from birth. 
PS: We still remember both of us receiving a call from home at the same time. They were just eagerly waiting for us to return home and tell them our decision."

    content: "Sometimes, things in an arranged marriage move too fast and in such an appealing way that we barely realize what is happening. By the time we had our first conversation on personal numbers, we were already hitched. The first question that we had for each other - What made you say 'Yes!' to me? We were just speechless. And we moved ahead with a faith - he who has led us so far will guide us further."

    content: "When we started chatting, we certainly didn't have any clue what was coming. Getting along with a new person can feel like compromising yourself. But in our case, it was pretty smooth. We felt like we know each other well. Our communication style, fundamental values and family upbringing were surprisingly the same. And in no time, we didnâ€™t realise that we were making memories. We just knew we were having fun."

    content: "Engagement rings are the most desired handcuffs in the world, and gems make them special as they are important for expressing love, gratitude, and significance. We had no idea when and what are we going to wear. The only thing we knew was that someday we were supposed to wear it. Once we tried it on, well... we nodded to each other. The rings claimed us."

    I would simply say this - She is worth millions of compliments and I will spend my entire life telling her how wonderful and stunning she is.
    Cheers to the great moment, unforgettable memory."
